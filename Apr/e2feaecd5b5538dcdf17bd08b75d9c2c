The Igbo Etiti Local Government Council in Enugu State has paid the West African Examination Council (WAEC) fees for 200 indigenous students in the area this year.  The council Chairman, Mr Malachy Agbo, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent on Thursday in Enugu. Agbo said the council did not discriminate along political party lines in the payment. He said that all students, irrespective of their background, would benefit from the educational provision as a means of making them feel the benevolence of government. According to him, the gesture was aimed at carrying everybody along and to make them feel part of the day to day governance of the local government. He explained that the council took the roll-calls of all the students in senior secondary three (SS3) classes, who are indigenes of Igbo Etiti. “We register them free of charge for the West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE). “We did not consider whether you are from the less-privileged or not,’’ Agbo said. He also promised that the council would provide desks in all the primary schools in the area to encourage reading and learning among pupils. Agbo explained that the council was running an inclusive government. “The old, the new and the adult have a say in what is happening in the council area.’’ The chairman said all stakeholders and traditional rulers were also being involved to contribute their quota in projects implementation. According to him, this has promoted good governance in all ramifications in the council.
