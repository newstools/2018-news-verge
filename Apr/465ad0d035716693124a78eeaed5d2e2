Miracle Igbokwe has continued to receive more accolades from BBNaija fans for winning the 2018 TV reality show late on Sunday in Lagos.  Mr Anjolaoluwa Irukera, a car dealer, told our reporter that Miracle’s success was well deserved due to his commitment to the various challenges and house tasks Biggie exposed all the housemates to. He said as an ardent fan of the show, he dedicated his time to watch how the various housemates showcased their talents then. He said that he had always seen that winning trait in the winner, Miracle. He said that the Nigerian youths should emulate Miracle’s calm and calculative nature which gave him the victory. ”Miracle deserves it because he was always showing enthusiasm toward the arena tasks and different challenges in the house, most of which he emerged the winner. ”He successfully won three different tasks from different companies before the end of the show. ”He used  the opportunity provided by the show to launch himself and his innate potential unlike some of the housemates who pay attention to frivolities,” he said. Mrs Helen Aregbeshola, a make-up artist, said that Miracle emerging as the winner translated to the fact that there was transparency in every process of the show. She said everyone including the evicted housemates had predicted that he would emerge as the winner. She said this assertion was reinforced by votes he scored when he was being put up for possible eviction. ”We can sense transparency in the process of voting and collation because majority who had been following the show had predicted Miracle as the winner. ”He deserves it and even more because he has succeeded in entertaining us which is the essence of the show,” she said.
