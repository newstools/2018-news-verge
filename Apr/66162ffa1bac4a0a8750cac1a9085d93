Tottenham Hotspur claimed a first victory at Chelsea for 28 years with Dele Alli scoring twice in the second half as they came back to win 3-1.  The victory cemented Spurs fourth place in the Premier League on Sunday. It looked like being a familiar tale of woe for the north London side when Hugo Lloris’s error of judgement allowed Alvaro Morata to head Chelsea in front after half an hour. Tottenham responded in first-half stoppage time with midfielder Christian Eriksen dipping a right-foot shot over a bemused Willy Caballero from 30 yards. Eriksen had already tested the Argentine with one fizzing effort. There was a growing sense of belief in Tottenham’s play after the interval and Alli struck twice from close range in four minutes just past the hour to turn the game on its head. Tottenham, who enjoyed a further boost when Harry Kane came off the bench having recovered from an ankle injury, moved eight points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea with seven games left. Tottenham are a team with momentum. They had not lost in the Premier League since Dec. 16 winning all four of their previous fixtures. And Eriksen, so often capable of creating something from nothing, carried the team again. They now have 64 points, two points behind third-placed Liverpool with a game in hand. Tottenham are just four points behind second-placed Manchester United and an FA Cup semi-final against Jose Mourinho’s men is on the horizon. Spurs players such as Alli appear to have regained form, as well as having their key player Harry Kane back.
