Britain’s Prince Harry has asked his elder brother Prince William to be his best man at his wedding to U.S. actress Meghan Markle next month, his office said in a statement on Thursday.  Harry was William’s best man at his own glittering wedding to wife Kate Middleton in 2011. “The Duke of Cambridge is honoured to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George’s Chapel, Windsor on May 19th,” Kensington Palace said. Some 600 guests are expected to attend Harry and Markle’s wedding service and a reception inside Windsor Castle, with hundreds of others, including members of the public, invited to watch the wedding from the castle grounds. Earlier this week William and Kate, whose official titles are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, celebrated the arrival of their third child.
