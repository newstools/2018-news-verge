The establishment of the Neighborhood Security Agency (NSA) is a statement of commitment to safety and security of all law-abiding residents in Rivers, says Governor Nyesom Wike.  The governor, represented by Mr Kenneth Kobani, Secretary to the State Government made the remark at the swearing-in ceremony of the 2018 Batch ‘A’ corps members in Nonwa-Gbam, Tai Local Government Area of Rivers. He stated that his administration would spare no resources in ensuring that the security of the corps members all through their service year was guaranteed. According to Wike, the government will continue to support the NYSC scheme towards making the corps members self-employed at end of the one year national service. “I have followed with interest, the NYSC programmes, especially the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) scheme. “I also commend the NYSC management for partnering with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to develop the capacity of corps members through the introduction of the Youth Innovative Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YIEDP). “This unique partnership is not only timely and sustainable, but equally remarkable,” he said. The Governor added the partnership would serve as a catalyst for the corps members to become entrepreneurs and positively turn around the fortunes of Nigeria’s dwindling economy. He however, urged corps members to shun cultism, religious intolerance, political violence and any form of anti-social behaviour. Mr Sunday Aroni, State Coordinator, NYSC Rivers, said that 2,770 corps members deployed to the state had reported and registered, out of which 1,362 were males while 1,388 were females. He thanked Gov. Wike for his support and fatherly disposition to the scheme.
