Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has become the first African player to score 10 goals in a single Champions League (CL) campaign, FIFA says on its Twitter handle @Fifacom.  The Egyptian has surpassed Samuel Eto’o’s record for most goals scored by an African player in a single CL season. Salah scored two first half goals for his team against AS Roma in the first leg Champions league semi final encounter at Liverpool which eventually ended 5-2 in favour of Juergen Kloop’s side on Tuesday. The team, which is reaching the semi finals of the competition for the first time in 10 years, will be relying on Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino when travel to Italy next week to secure a final berth. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid meet in the other semi-final on Wednesday.
