Former Lagos Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav has lambasted defecting Nigerian politicians for lacking political ideology. He said  they were in politics to sustain themselves.  Tsav who was reacting to the defection of 15 senators and Gov Samuel Ortom from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said the behaviour clearly confirms that Nigerian politicians lack ideology. Gov Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday formally defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He had said last week that he was available outside the pitch to be recruited by another party after the state APC had given him a red card. Tsav told our correspondent on Wednesday in Makurdi that those defecting lack any  political ideology as they were in politics to sustain themselves. He said the youths whose future was being destroyed by the actions and inactions of these crop of politicians were regrettably celebrating their actions. “The current defections and counter defections of our politicians from one political party to another sadly confirm that our politicians are deeply corrupt and without ideology. “Most of them are in politics to sustain themselves with stolen money but not to serve the electorate. How can we grow and develop as a Nation? “Unfortunately the youths whose future is being wantonly destroyed jubilate over this. God help Nigeria,” he said.
