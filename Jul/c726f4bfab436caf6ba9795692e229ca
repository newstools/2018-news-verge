France are expected to be at full strength when they take on Uruguay in their World Cup quarter-final on Friday after assistant coach, Guy Stephan, described Djibril Sidibe’s injury as a minor scare.  Full back Sidibe limped out of Sunday’s training session with an ankle injury, a day after France beat Argentina 4-3 in the last 16. “It’s nothing serious. I can’t say he’ll train with the others today, and his ankle is bruised but it’s nothing big,” Stephan told a news conference on Monday. He added that full back Lucas Hernandez was nursing a minor muscle problem. Another full back, Benjamin Mendy, had suffered a thigh muscle problem but “he will resume his activity today,” said Stephan.
