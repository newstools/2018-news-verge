Amazon Workers across Germany are planning to disrupt one of the U.S. retail giant’s busiest shopping days this week with strike, the German Trade Union Verdi announced on Monday.  Prime Day, a 36-hour sale which began on Monday, is a major money-spinner for the company. In Germany, warehouse workers are planning walkouts Tuesday in the cities of Leipzig and Koblenz, as well as the towns of Bad Hersfeld in Hesse, Graben in Bavaria and Rheinberg and Werne in North Rhine Westphalia. There was also strike action planned in Poland and Spain, the union said. Verdi has been demanding a collective wage agreement for Amazon’s 16,000 workers across Germany since 2013, but the retail giant has refused to engage with the union on the issue. An Amazon spokesperson said it was possible to be a fair and responsible employer without offering a collective wage agreement. The strikes are focused on health policy. “The message is clear: The online giant is getting rich at the expense of the health of its staff,’’ said Verdi spokesperson Stefanie Nutzenberger. Verdi’s concerns include long shifts, strenuous and monotonous work, and severe physical and mental stress. The union wants contractual health measures for employees. Amazon said it did not expect the strikes to affect its delivery times.
