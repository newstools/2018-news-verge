The Centre for Citizens with Disabilities ( CCD )  has called on the Federal Government to use $322m General Sani Abacha loot to make life better for people living  with disabilities.  Speaking in Lagos today, during a briefing with journalists, the Executive Director of the CCD, Mr. David Anyaele, said rather than going ahead with such a plan, the Federal Government should invest the money in the rehabilitation of PWDs, who represent some of the poorest people in the society. According to him, people in this category have suffered a lot of injustice over the years, with successive administrations in the country unwilling to improve their living conditions. He said, â€œCCD wishes to express gratitude to Federal government and good people of Switzerland for the release of the loot by Abacha to Federal government. Also appreciated the Nigeria government for the declaration of the total amount recovered from swiss authorities. It was noted that; the recovered loot has been the subject of debate in recent days, with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration announcing plans to distribute the money among the poorest Nigerians.
