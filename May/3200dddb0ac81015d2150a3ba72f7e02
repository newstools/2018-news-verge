An All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain in Rivers, Mr Christian Don-Pedro, on Wednesday said the party in the state was united.  Don-Pedro told our reporter in Port Harcourt that APC in Rivers was united behind Mr Chibuike Amaechi, former governor of the state. He said that the interests of governorship aspirants could not be seen as division in the party. “The truth of the matter is that political parties are vehicles or platforms to realise political aspirations; so, the different interests as expressed should not be seen as division in the party. “The Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, who is the leader of APC in Rivers, has the right to support whoever he likes and vice versa. “So, you cannot say that because Amaechi is not supporting one aspirant, there is division in APC in Rivers; I say this because there are many aspirants,” he said. Don-Pedro congratulated Mr Ojukaye Flag-Amachree on his emergence as chairman of the party in the state, saying his election was an answer for ways to defeat the ruling party in the in the state in 2019. “It is a message to our opponents that the APC in Rivers is united and ready to wrestle power from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “The youthfulness of Flag-Amachree, our dynamic chairman, has injected in us, the vigour and unquenchable courage to face 2019,” he said. The party stalwart urged the new chairman to ensure that youths that were hungry for power were engaged to secure maximum victory. He commended Amaechi for being “a servant leader’’ in APC in the state and prayed that God would protect him.
