Gov. Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti has appealed to the Federal Government and the Chief Justice of Nigeria to provide more judges and a Customary Court of Appeal in the state.  Fayose made the appeal during the inauguration of the ultra-modern four-storey State High Court complex in Ekiti on Thursday. He said that the edifice was named after the Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti, Mr Ademola Ajakaiye, being the pioneer Judge of the State High Court. The governor said he dedicated the complex to the people of Ekiti, adding that it would stand the test of time. Noting that the Judiciary is the last hope of the common man, Fayose said he would ensure that the complex was well maintained. Earlier, Gov. Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom applauded Fayose’s developmental efforts and achievements in the state. He said that a government that had performed well deserved continuity “ hence I enjoin Ekiti people to continue to support Peoples Democratic Party in the state’’. In his speech, Aare Afe Babalola, the founder of Afe Babalola University, applauded the governor, for bequeathing a worthy legacy to the state. He appealed to indigenes of the state at home and in the Diaspora to assist in the state’s development. Similarly, the Chairman, Nigerian Bar Association, Ado Ekiti Branch, Mr Gbemiga Adaramola, ‎ thanked Fayose for fullfiling his promise. The Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti thanked God and the governor for the honour done him in his life time. “May God grant the governor of the state all his heart’s desires,’’ he said‎. In his remark, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Mr Walter Onnoghen, thanked the governor for providing a befitting working environment for the state judiciary. He enjoined other state governors to emulate Fayose by improving the well-being of the Judiciary of their states. He urged judges to be proactive by ensuring speedy and unbiased judgments. The highpoint of the occasion was the inauguration of the state High Court ‎complex.
