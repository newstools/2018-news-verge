French President, Emmanuel Macron, has claimed credit for solving a political crisis in Lebanon in 2017, stating publicly that Saudi Arabia held Prime Minister, Saad al-Hariri, for several weeks.  Lebanon was plunged into crisis in November when Hariri resigned as prime minister while in Saudi Arabia. The PM said he feared assassination and criticising the Saudis’ regional rival Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Lebanese officials accused the Saudis, at the time, of holding Hariri hostage. After the international intervention, including by Macron, Hariri was able to leave the kingdom and eventually rescinded his resignation. “If France hasn’t listened to them, there probably would be a war in Lebanon at this moment as we speak. “It’s French diplomacy, it’s our action,’’ Macron said in an interview with broadcaster BFM TV, visibly irritated after being asked if his foreign policy over the last year had achieved anything. Macron said an unscheduled stopover in Riyadh to convince Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, followed by an invitation to Hariri to come to France, had been the catalyst to ending the crisis. “I remind you that a prime minister was held in Saudi Arabia for several weeks,’’ he said, a comment that could irk Riyadh which, like Hariri, denied he was ever held against his will. Macron dined with Hariri and Prince Mohammed in Paris in April after a conference to rally international support for an investment programme to boost the Lebanese economy.
