Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is not expected to return for the remaining two games of the English Premier League season due to a back injury.  However, the German is confident he will be fit for the FIFA World Cup starting next month in Russia. Ozil, who played in Arsenal’s 1-0 UEFA Europa League semi-final second leg defeat at Atletico Madrid last week, watched from the stands as Arsenal thrashed Burnley 5-0 at the weekend. He wrote on Twitter that it was a “pity” he missed Sunday’s match due to the injury. “It’ll need some time but I’m sure I’ll fully recover in time for the World Cup,” he added. Arsenal wrap up the season against Leicester City on Wednesday and Huddersfield Town on Sunday. Defending champions Germany begin their World Cup campaign in Russia against Mexico on June 17.
