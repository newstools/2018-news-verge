A philanthropist and Igbo leader in Lagos, Chief Chika Nwokedi, says the time has come for youths to take up leadership roles in the country.  Nwokedi, who is the President-General of an Igbo socio-cultural Organisation, Ndigbo Buru Otu Association of Nigeria, told newsmen in Lagos on Thursday that he had decided to take up the challenge politically in his state, Imo. “We, the youths, have the ability and the technical know-how. We should resist analogue mode of governance and embrace digital ideas,’’ the 45-year-old philanthropist said. Nwokedi, who became chairman of Ladipo Market Traders Association at the age of 24, said had decided to make more impact politically. He said that he would vie for governorship in Imo in 2019, but would keep his platform close to his chest for now. The businessman urged other youth to rise up to the challenge of leadership and make the desired impact. Nwokedi said aside being a youth, his political interest was motivated divinely and not by any godfather or family. He urged Imo indigenes at home and abroad to get their Permanent Voter Cards so as to exercise their franchise. The philanthropist said Imo was in need of better road networks with link bridges. He said there was also need to create gainful employment opportunities for youths to discourage social vices in the society.
