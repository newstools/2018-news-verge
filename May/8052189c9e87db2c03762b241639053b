We will soon be at par with our colleagues in the western world. We will keep pushing and soon, we shall be there,” he said. On the opening of ‘The Dome after almost 10 year of closure, the co-host of Jara on Africa Magic said it was great for the centre to have come back to life again. According to him he was hosted by the Dome when he won the Big Brother Africa reality TV show some years ago. “It is a nice feeling to see that they have rebranded, relaunched and have revamped the establishment. ”The growth is a good thing and I am so happy to be part of it,” he said. When asked on government contribution to the entertainment industry, he said “government should make sure funds allocated to the sector are traced and monitored. ”This will ensure that the funds are use to do what they are suppose to be use for,” he submitted.
