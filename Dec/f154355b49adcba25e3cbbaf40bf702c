Midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is excited about Leicester City’s 2-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City at the King Power Staduim on Wednesday.  On his twitter handle @ndidi25, the Super Eagles player wrote “3 points in the bag, Foxes never quit,” he tweeted. Claude Puel’s men are on seventh position with 28 points, also thanks to their victory against Chelsea at the weekend. Meanwhile the loss is City’s second consecutive English Premier League defeat after a 2-3 loss to Crystal Palace as Pep Guardiola’s side falls to third place, seven points behind table toppers Liverpool.
