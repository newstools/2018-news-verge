National Assembly staff under the aegis of Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), had fixed Dec.4 to stage a protest over unpaid salaries and allowances.  Mr Suleiman Haruna, the union’s Secretary-General, announced this in a statement in Abuja. Haurna said the first phase of the protest would take place between Dec. 4 and Dec. 8. The association said the move had become necessary following nonchalant attitude of the national assembly leadership to toward their demands. He explained that the action would be a blend of protest and picketing of offices within the assembly, adding that the union would not tolerate default from members. According to him, the action will commence between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily within the stipulated days. Haruna explained that members were demanding to be put on the Consolidated Legislative Salary Structure (CONLESS). “Also, all pending staff promotions and conversion letters should be released with arrears fully paid on or before Dec.31. “The association has already issued a two-week ultimatum to the management to fulfill these demands or face strike,” he said.
