The Legal Aid Council of Nigeria on Monday, said it treated only 13 cases in Kano State in the month of November through its free legal services to  those who could not afford to pay for such.  The state Coordinator of the Council, Alhaji Abubakar Umar, who made the disclosure in an interview with our correspondent in Kano,said that five of the cases were criminal matters, while the remaining eight were civil cases. Acording to him, the council during the period completed two criminal cases and four civil cases, while others were still pending in court. Umar, who, explained that some of the civil cases were resolved out-of-court, added that the council offered free legal service and advice to those who could not afford to pay for such services. He said most of the civil cases were on non-payment of pension and retirement benefits, mostly by privately-owned companies and pension fund administrators. Umar said other cases were on land disputes, marriage and debts recovery. “Some of the criminal cases were on armed robbery, criminal breach of trust, homicide, rape and theft,” he said. Umar, however, noted that the major challenges facing the council were lack of fund and inadequate manpower.
