An expert in Solar power and project management of Dantata Solar, Mr Babajide  Oyeneye  has said that Solar Power developer provides sustainable solution for industries and public sector. Oyeneye said this during the ’17th edition of seminar series on the potentials of renewable energy in Nigeria’ , held in Lagos   that the current electrification rate in Nigeria is about 60% and the demand increasing by the day due to the increase in population and economic activites. Oyeneye further explained renewable energy in particular solar photovoltaic can contribute immensely to the improvement of energy supply to this sector and to Nigeria as a whole.Solar power may become the most preferred alternative electricity source to Nigerians, judging by recent developments, despite the economic barriers to its growth, he said. Nigeria solar power market has moved with great impression on electricity consumers who are fast embracing it to overcome the poor supply from the national electricity grid, Oyeneye explained. The Vice president of Solar23 GmbH, Mr Oliver Drücke explained that a sustainable global energy supply provide by solar energy. Drücke explained that  sustainable global energy supply provided by solar energy and solar photovoltaic (PV) in Nigeria are developed excel based too to allow investor to calculate different PV  business model. The imposition of arbitrary port charges will accelerate value destruction in this industry and will cause prices to rise to uncompetitive levels, he said. All over the world, the cost of solar panels is falling, hence increased adoption of renewables, Drücke explain
