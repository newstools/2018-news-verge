Earlier, The Vice President, Global Christians Network, Dr Bolaji Akinyemi, said that nation building did not belong only to political leadership but also to Nigerians who lived each day with hope and anticipation of a better future. Akinyemi, also the President of Permanent  voters Card (PVC), Naija, told the group of young intellectuals that building a nation was every person’s responsibility. “Nation building or working together to strengthen our national identity, or sense of belonging in our country is not only for political leaders but belongs to people who live each day with hope and anticipation of a better future, and whose authority and voice is reflected through the ballot box with the right to vote,” he said. “I am here to share my experiences and aspirations on leadership with these young people. It is really to get our young people to look at where we are now and to think of where we are going in the future. “It’s the young people who will be the leaders and we should start helping them to look at challenging issues. “These issues are about responsibility and accountability, how we use public funds for the good of our nation. “Building a nation means, sometimes you have to give up something of your own for others to benefit,” he said.
