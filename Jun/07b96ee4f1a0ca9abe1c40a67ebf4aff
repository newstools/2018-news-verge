The Jigawa State office of the National Identity Cards Commission (NIMC), says it has established registration centres in the 26 Local Government Areas of the state.  Mr Aminu Jakada, the coordinator of the commission in the state, made this known on Wednesday in an interview with our correspondent in Dutse. Jakada said the centres were established in collaboration with state government in order to speed up the enrollment of residents. He expressed hope that the local centres would enable residents to register easily with the commission. “With the support of Jigawa government, we were able to provide registration centres in 26 out of the 27 LGAs. “And even the last one will be established soon in the 27th LGA. This is to enable people register with ease. “The provision of these centres will also speed up the registration exercise as people don’t have to come to the state capital to register. “People can now register in their respective LGAs without necessarily coming to Dutse to register, the gesture will definitely speed up the exercise,” he said. He urged the people to avail themselves of the opportunity by visiting any of the centres close to their localities for registration. He revealed that the Jigawa government had also set up a committee to enlighten residents on the need to register and obtain their cards. “The committee set up by the state government to mobilise people is very important. “This is because before the committee, the turn-out of people for registration was very poor, but now people are trooping to all our centres to register,” Jakada said.
