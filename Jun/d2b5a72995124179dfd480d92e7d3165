The Police on Friday docked a 29-year-old man, Victor Ekpo, in a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly stealing kerosene worth N487, 306.  Ekpo, who resides at Katampe Street, Kubwa, Abuja, was docked on charges bordering on criminal breach of trust and cheating. The prosecutor, Mr Babajide Olanipekun, told the court that one Atat Ekpedeme reported the matter at the Kubwa Police Station on May 15. He said the defendant deceived the complainant to give him N487, 306, in the pretext of supplying him kerosene, which he did not fulfil. Olanipekun said that the defendant converted the said sum to his personal use, adding that the offences contravened Sections 311 and 322 of the Penal Code. Ekpo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The judge, Abdulwahab Mohammed, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N400, 000, with one surety in like sum. He adjourned the matter until Aug. 15 for hearing.
