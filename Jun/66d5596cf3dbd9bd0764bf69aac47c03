Gov. Aminu Masari of Katsina State has felicitated with Muslims over the completion of the Ramadan fast and urged them to make the lessons learnt as “their life habit’’.  Masari made the appeal in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr Audu Labaran, on Thursday in Katsina. “Having gone through the fasting period in devotion, obedience, charity, perseverance and respect for others, these traits should be a life time habit that should outlive the limited period which the Ramadan fasting was observed,’’ he said. Masari also urged Nigerians to continue to live in peace with one another and pray for the nation and its leaders. “The governor praised non-Muslims who became their brother’s keeper by joining in feeding less privileged Muslims in many parts of the country. “This is exactly the attitude that we should strive to imbibe to make our country great and shame the enemies of Nigeria’s progress,’’ he said.
