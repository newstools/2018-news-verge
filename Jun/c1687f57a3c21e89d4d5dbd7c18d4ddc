Chief Ugochukwu Nnam, President of Initiative for Leadership Development and Change (ILDC), says the newly elected Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Adams Oshiomole is a man with integrity and leadership initiatives.  Nnam told our reporter in Abuja that APC took a laudable decision by electing the former Edo governor as its national chairman. He said the former Nigeria Labour Congress leader had the capacity to turn around the party for the better with his experience in both economic and human management. “Oshiomole has been tested and trusted in various capacities ranging from labour unionism to politics. “You will agree with me that he delivered excellently, therefore he shall bring such experience to APC leadership,’’ Nnam said. The group’s leader said that APC’s journey to greatness had begun with the emergence of a seasoned administrator like Oshiomole. He added that it was time for the party to consolidate on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari by supporting Oshiomole. Nnam, who noted that political disagreement had been a necessary feature of democracy, called on politicians to close ranks for a greater Nigeria. He urged Nigerians to continue to support democracy in spite of its challenges, saying that “worst democracy is better than the best military rule’’. It was reported that the ruling APC on June 23 elected its national leadership where Adams Oshiomole emerged as chairman.
