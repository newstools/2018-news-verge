The National Union of Transport Workers (NURTW) taxi sector has cried out over arrested of loyal members by Lagos state police.  Chairman of the Union, Otunba Olatunji Odujobi said this during a meeting that “NURTW taxi sector do not see any logical reasons now why they should be subjected to victimized, molested and mass arrested with collaborations bu Nigeria Police in Lagos”. According to Odujobi all the taxi parks member are fully registered with appropriate Local Councils within the state government . “It was recalled that since February 14, 2007 the so called Lagos state Taxi and Cab operators association led by Tajudeen Adetoro and Taiwo Omolekan wrote petition against the NURTW taxi sector that the union is operating illegal in Lagos State, which led to the arrested by Nigeria Police at Panti  . Odujobi further said that, we are professional taxi driver operating under NURTW taxi sector since 1979 when Former Governor of Lagos state Jakande established the taxi cabs services in the state with a yellow and Black striped color. NURTW taxi sector are law abiding citizen, yet we have been humiliated. We say no more arrests from our parks or else we shall be forced to react, we can no more be victims any longer Odujobi said.
