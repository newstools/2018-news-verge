The Senate Leader, Dr Ahmad Lawan, on Monday condoled with Yobe council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) over the death of its member, Mr Jonathan Gopep.  Lawan expressed his feelings in a condolence letter presented by his Chief of Staff, Alhaji Ahmad Amshi, to the state NUJ Chairman, Mr Yusuf Isa, in Damaturu. The senator described the death of late Jonathan as a great shock and sad loss to the profession, the union and the nation at large. “There is no doubt that this is a sad loss not only to the union, his family but the nation at large. Jonathan was an astute, brilliant and dedicated journalist,” he said. Responding, Isa commended the legislator for his concern and sympathy to the council. “This is the first condolence the union is officially receiving over the death of Mr Late Jonathan Gopep; we appreciate your sense of concern and sympathy for the union at this trying moment,” he said. Until his death, the deceased was a staff of the state television and freelance journalists with Channels television. Gopep, 45, died on May 17, 2018, after a brief illness.
