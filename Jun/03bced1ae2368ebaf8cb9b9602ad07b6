The Better Nigeria Movement, a Non-Governmental Organisation, has  commended  President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to  the Not-Too Young-To-Run Bill.  Mr Sambo Abdulfatah, the National Coordinator of the group, told our reporter in Port Harcourt on Monday that the new Act  would improve the quality of  leadership in the country. According to him, the Act  will pave way for intending youths to seek elective positions in their areas of political interest. “The Act  could not  have come at a better time than now that Nigerians are tired of having recycled leaders in power. “It is now  time for  our youths to take the bull by the horns  and take charge of the country,’’ he said. Abdulfatah  also said the Act  would ensure the exit from power  of  leaders who over the years had led the country with ideas that were outdated. “If Nigeria must be great again, we need to inject young and vibrant people into the system to move the nation on the path of progress. “In any given environment and in all conditions, sustaining heritage calls for the involvement of young people in  leadership,’’ he said. Abdulfatah, however,  urged political parties to give equal opportunities to young people to run for political office without room for gender preferences. He commended the National Assembly for the passage of  the bill and called on the legislators to come up with more bills that would improve the lives of Nigerians.
