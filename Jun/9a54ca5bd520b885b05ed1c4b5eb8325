Undocumented migrants should not have the right to choose a country, where they will request for asylum, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.  On Sunday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker convened what he called an “informal working meeting” on migration issues, with all interested EU member states invited to participate “On the one hand we cannot abandon the countries accepting refugees, because it would mean that they should deal with all the problems on their own, that it was not a common decision. “But on the other hand, illegal transporters and refugees cannot chose on their own, in which European state they will request for asylum,” Merkel told reporters after the meeting. The politician added that the participants of meeting had agreed that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency
should be strengthened as soon as possible. Since 2015, Europe has been experiencing its worst migration crisis in recent history, struggling to accommodate
hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing hostilities in the Middle Eastern and North African countries.
