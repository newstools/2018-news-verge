The Executive Director of Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD), Mr David Anyaele, has identified environmental, attitudinal, institutional as well as  accessibility challenges facing Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) from participating in elections in Nigeria.  Speaking with our correspondent in Ado-Ekiti on Friday, Anyaele said that the challenges serve as deterrents further denying PWDs participation in the electoral process. He also said that inaccessible materials and procedures would undermine their ability to exercise their democratic rights in  participating freely and fully in each of the steps in  the voting process. Anyaele further called on the National Assembly to amend Section 56 of the Electoral Act to replace the word ‘may’ with ‘shall’ in order to hold INEC accountable for the implementation of the provision. He also called on the National Assembly to transmit the Nigeria Disability Bill to the president for his assent, adding that the bill had  been passed since March although it had yet to be sent for assent. The CCD executive director urged INEC to carefully choose the location of polling units to ensure that they are accessible for PWDs. It was reported that CCD is a not-for-profit organisation for people living with disabilities. It works to promote inclusion, participation, access, and mainstreaming of issues of critical concern for members of the group in the activities of state and non-state institutions.
