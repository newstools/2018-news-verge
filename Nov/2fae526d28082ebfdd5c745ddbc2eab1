The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Solomon Dalung, on Tuesday urged the Church in Nigeria to always engage government and stop limiting themselves to be at the receiving end.  Dalung said this when he received the Executive Council of the Church of Christ in Nation (COCIN) in his office. Our correspondent recalls that the 25-man delegation had earlier met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential villa to seek lasting peace in some conflict ravaged cities. “They visited the President to state some of the challenges confronting Christians in Jos; they decided to visit me as one of their own and to appreciate me for facilitating the visit to Mr. President. ”My appeal to them is that the church should continue to engage the government and not to be a back-bencher or limiting themselves to be at the receiving end. ”When things happen, they should try to engage government; seek explanations and express their concern; they should also proffer solutions,” Dalung said. Responding, the General Secretary of COCIN, Rev. Dr. Amos Mohzo, thanked the minister for assisting them to see the president and prayed that the president’s promises would materialise. “We want to thank you that we were able to see the president through you; we are very happy and we pray that all Mr. President’s promises will be work on,” Mohzo said.
