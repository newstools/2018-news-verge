Chairman of Senate Committee on Works, Sen. Kabiru Gaya, has charged contractors handling roads projects across the country to execute quality jobs, warning that the committee would not compromise standards.  Gaya gave the charge on Tuesday while addressing newsmen at the end of a two-day inspection tour of federal road projects in Oyo state. He said that the tour as successful as it provided the committee the opportunity to ascertain levels of completion of road projects in the state. He added that the inspection also afforded the committee members opportunity to see and experience the deplorable state of Ibadan-Oyo road that was constructed and completed three years ago. ”It is very sad that the road that gulped N22 billion and delivered three years ago could be so bad. ”What we have seen is unacceptable and the committee is going to investigate reasons behind the shoddy construction work on the road. ”The PW Construction Company that executed the project will be invited for questioning,” he stated. Other roads inspected by the committee were 72.7-kilometre Ibadan-Abeokuta road, 52-kilometre Oyo-Ogbomoso road and 57.7-kilometre Ogbomoso-Oko-Ilogbo-Osogbo road. Gaya urged KOPEK Construction Company and Renoid Construction Company handling Ibadan-Abeokuta and Oyo-Ogbomoso road projects to deliver good jobs. He promised that the committee would do its best to address their complaints to fast-track early completion of the projects. Earlier, Mr Pascal Harfouch, Spokesman for KOPEK, said the Ibadan-Abeokuta road being handled by the company would be ready soon if the Federal Government released more fund for its completion. The Chief Engineer of RCC, Mr Fedi Natour, promised to deliver quality jobs but urged the committee members to assist in getting their demands. Our correspondent reports that Sen. Abiodun Olujimi, Sen. Sanni Mustapha and Sen. Abdulfatai Buhari, were among the committee members that took part in the inspection.
