Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra, on Sunday urged religious leaders to ensure that their teachings promote peace, love and unity in the state.  Obiano stated this during a thanksgiving ceremony in honour of Prof. Charles Esimone, President of the Full Gospel Business Men’s Fellowship International, Royal Chapter, Awka. Represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr Nkem Okeke, Obiano also called for love, unity and tolerance amongst religious bodies for meaningful development and sustainability of developmental projects. The governor said that the benefit of peaceful co-existence in any society cannot be measured hence people of all religions must strive to live at peace with each other. ‘’Religious leaders must cultivate attitudes that will unite the people and sustained developments across the State. According to the governor, leaders are being seen as role models and as such, it is expected that they feed the members with teachings that would promote peace love and unity. ‘’There is need for religious harmony in the State to help sustain the relative peace being enjoyed by the citizenry and to attract more developmental projects as no investor would invest in any troubled state.’’ He cautioned the people against engaging in land tussle which he said was becoming rampant in the state adding that any issues must be resolved through dialogue. Earlier in his sermon, Prof. Mosto Onuoha, President of Nigeria Academy of Science University of Nigeria Nsukka, charged Christians to always trust in God who is capable of providing all their needs. Also, Esimone said that he was happy to be honored and urged all present to always apply the principle of peaceful resolution in time of crisis.
