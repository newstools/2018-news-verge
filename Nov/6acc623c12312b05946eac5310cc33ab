The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has attributed the outage being experienced by electricity consumers in Benin City to maintenance work being carried out by Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC).  Mrs Ndidi Nba, the General Manager, Public Affairs, TCN, said this in a statement in Benin. She that the outage was also due a branch of a tree that fell and tripped the breakers of T21 60MVA transformer during the maintenance work. According to the general manager, this occurred on Nov. 7 and is caused by BEDC maintenance crew. “Bulk power supply to the area has been restored and is on load shedding through a back feed from transformer T24 to bring relief to GRA, Etete, Switch Station, Koko, Ikpoba Dam and Nkpenekpen. “TCN regrets the situation and reassures customers that normal supply will be restored as soon as TCN engineers rectify the damaged breakers,” she said.
