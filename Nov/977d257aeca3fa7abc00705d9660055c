Gov. Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State has lauded the Federal Government over the award of contract for the expansion and dualisation of Abuja-Keffi-Lafia-Makurdi road.  Al-Makura gave the commendation on Thursday in Keffi at the launch of the 227.4-kilometer project by the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola. He said that the benefit of the project to commuters and communities along the road corridors when completed was enormous. “The expansion of the road from the existing six to 10 lanes from Abuja to Keffi will give a lot of relief to commuters and communities along the road corridors in FCT and Nasarawa State. “With the coming of this dualisation, our roads will last longer because the pressure on them will be drastically reduced. “It will also increase access of the rural communities from their farm to the market and enhance security of lives and property,” he said. Al-Makura said that the launch of the project was a sign of commitment of the Federal Government to improving the economic activities in rural communities. He said the state government had keyed into the initiative of the Federal Government of providing infrastructure in the state. The governor said that the government had provided 60 kilometers of road between Lafia and Keffi to reduce pressure on the federal highway. “The Federal Government is doing much to ensure the completion of some of the federal projects we have commenced during the previous administration. “The Federal Secretariat in Lafia is begging for completion and I want to use this opportunity to appeal to the minister to come to our rescue,” he said.
