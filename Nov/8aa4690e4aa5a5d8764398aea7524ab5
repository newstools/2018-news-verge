Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has assured the people that all ongoing roads projects in the state would be completed on schedule.  The governor gave the assurance on Monday after inspecting some road projects in Boji-Boji Agbor, Ika South Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent reports that the governor inspected the road projects on Queens Street and Delta Development and Property Authority (DDPA) Estate, Agbor. “I am happy with the quality of projects though we noticed that some factors were not taken into consideration at Queens Street, the right thing would be done because, our people in all parts of the state deserve necessary infrastructure. “Contractors have mobilised to sites and as a government, we always utilise the dry season to the fullest to construct roads. “We have mapped out our payment strategy; our contractors are doing very well and have also keyed into our programme to fully utilise the dry season,” he said. He said that the storm drainage projects in Asaba would be delivered on schedule, adding that the contractors would meet the February, 2019 deadline. The governor said that some of the drainage projects had been completed while others were at different stages of completion. “The contractors are world class; once they give you their words, they deliver and we are comfortable doing business with them,” Okowa said. Our correspondent also reports that the state Commissioner for Works, Chief James Auguye, conducted the governor round the project sites.
