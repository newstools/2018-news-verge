The All Progressives Congress (APC) has alerted security agencies over the influx of thugs into some Kwara communities ahead of Ekiti/Irepodun/Isin/Oke-ero Federal Constituency bye-election slated for Saturday, November 17, 2018. Mr Femi David, the Personal Assistant on Media to Mr Raheem Olawuyi, the APC candidate, raised the concern in a statement issued and made available to newsmen on Friday in Omu-Aran. The statement identified some of the communities as; Iji-isin, Ijara-Isin, Owu-isin, Iwo-isin, Oke-onigbin, Esie, Osi, idofin-igbana, Omu-Aran among others. It stated that the thugs were purposely brought into the areas to instil fear in the minds of the voters ahead of the all important poll. The party said it viewed the development, which had caused unnecessary panic among residents, as undemocratic and an attempt to disenfranchise its patriotic and loyal supporters. “We have on good authority that quite some numbers of political thugs have been drafted into some of the communities where the by-election has been scheduled to hold on Saturday. “We have already alerted the security agencies and other relevant stakeholders of this development and they have assured us of prompt intervention in terms of adequate security and surveillance. “Our supporters across the constituency are hereby urged not to entertain any fear of intimidation, harassment and that the desired freedom would surely be achieved devoid of violence. “While intimidation and thuggery in electioneering remained the pastime of the opposition, we in APC will continue to toe the line of tolerance, peaceful co-existence and fair play. “We called on security agencies not to relent in the discharge of their responsibilities by beaming their searchlight on the aforementioned identified areas.
