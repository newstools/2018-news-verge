The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted a media report that it consistently breached most of its duties and obligations under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act over the last seven years.  The Ministry Spokesperson, Mr George Edokpa, said this in a statement in Abuja. “It is pertinent to clarify that the Ministry is in compliance with provisions of the FOI Act 2011 and carries out its responsibilities. He said the ministry did this “proactively in line with the provisions of the Act to protect and project the image of the country and foreign policy agenda.“ “Contrary to the misleading report, there is a Desk Officer in the Ministry, assigned to handle requests under the FOI Act. “The Ministry also engages in periodic and systematic dissemination of relevant information to the public of its activities and programmes, through regular press briefings and press releases,” he said He explained that the mandate, structure and organisation of the ministry were clearly provided in the ministry’s website which he noted fell under proactive disclosure of information under the FOI Act. According to him, such information is also contained on the websites of Nigerian Missions around the globe and on notice boards, as the case may be. “The ministry also receives and responds to enquiries sent to its official email: info@foreignaffairs.gov.ng. “Therefore, the public should disregard the allegation that the Ministry is not in compliance with the FOI Act,”
