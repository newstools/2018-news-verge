Alexandre Lacazette extended Arsenal’s unbeaten run to 14 games and dealt a blow to Liverpool’s quest to win the Premier League for the first time in nearly three decades by salvaging a 1-1 draw at the Emirates on Saturday. James Milner’s opener just after the hour mark looked set to send Jurgen Klopp’s men three points clear of champions Manchester City, who host Southampton on Sunday, at the top of the table. However, that lead is now a solitary point as Lacazette struck eight minutes from time to give the hosts a well-deserved point from an enthralling encounter. After a baptism of fire in defeats to City and Chelsea in his first two matches as Arsenal’s first new manager for 22 years, Unai Emery has impressively put his stamp on the Gunners. However, in a run of 12 wins and a draw before Liverpool’s visit, Arsenal hadn’t faced any side that finished ahead of them in Arsene Wenger’s last season. In contrast to their last visit to the Emirates when they conceded three times in five minutes, Liverpool needed to show their new-found defensive resolve as a confident Arsenal started the brighter. Alisson Becker spread himself well to block from Lacazette before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s deflected effort from the edge of the area flew just wide. Granit Xhaka fired too close to Alisson from a well-worked corner, but the Brazilian international was fortunate when he rushed from his goal and was beaten to a floated cross by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose header drifted inches wide. However, Liverpool also had plenty of chances in a thrilling first half that somehow lacked only goals.
