The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the National Assembly to use their constitutional power to override President Muhammadu Buhari on the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.  PDP made the call in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Monday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that Buhari’s veto did not come as a surprise, since his commitment to a free and fair 2019 election was “mere lip service”. He said that it had become clear to Nigerians that the reasons adduced by the president for withholding assent to Bills were “lame excuses”. “The clerical and drafting arguments put forward by President Buhari could not in any way outweigh the importance of amendments meant to engender free, fair, credible and transparent elections in 2019. “The PDP therefore charges the National Assembly to stand with Nigerians in the overall quest for credible elections by immediately overriding President Buhari on the bill.”
