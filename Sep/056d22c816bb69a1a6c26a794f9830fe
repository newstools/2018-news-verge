The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has urged its staff in the North-Central Zonal Office to redouble their efforts in order to reposition the agency for a more effective and efficient disaster management.  The Director-General of the agency, Mr Mustapha Mai’haja, gave the charge while declaring a three-day retreat for staff members on Tuesday in Akwanga, Nasarawa state. Mai’haja said that the retreat provided an opportunity to appraise both the operational and administrative performance of the agency. The director-general, who was represented by the North Central Zonal Coordinator, Mr Lugard Slaku, the retreat would also help in designing the step-by-step approach to move the agency to greater heights. He said that the series of both natural and human-induced disasters in the country leading to loss of lives and properties, had increased the pressure on staff of the agency. “While I commend the staff for their efforts so far, there is a great need for re-orientation by strengthening capacity to embrace new ways and best practice of coordinating disasters.’’ He commended all stakeholders, especially the media for their contributions to the attainment of the agency’s vision and mandate. The director-general urged all hands to be on deck towards effective disaster management in the country. On the warning of impending flooding in parts of the country, Mai’haja said that NEMA had been engaging with stakeholders on what to do to mitigate the effects of such disasters. “We are not a rescue agency per se, but we coordinate all the agencies with the necessary equipment and personnel for effective disaster management,’’ the director-general said.
