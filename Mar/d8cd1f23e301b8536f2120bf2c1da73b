David Silva underlined his importance to Manchester City’s impending title success with both goals on Monday night in the 2-0 Premier League win over Stoke City.  The Spaniard put City ahead in the 10th minute, finishing off a move of stunning simplicity with a confident strike from a Raheem Sterling low cross. Stoke, next to bottom in the table, showed plenty of endeavour but City were always in charge. Silva doubled the advantage five minutes after the break, converting after a swift exchange with Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus. Pep Guardiola’s City are 16 points clear of second-placed Manchester United and need just three more wins from their remaining eight games to be sure of the title. The Manchester City said during his post-match interview: “We created enough chances and we were solid. “I am so happy, it is the first time after 18 years we beat Stoke home and away and now we are two or three games away from being champions. “We have one week training in better conditions now, we will see our draw in the Champions League next Friday. Sooner or later we will be champions if we play like this. “It doesn’t matter when we win it.” Stoke City boss Paul Lambert conceded defeat to a superior side, adding that he was happy his side didn’t put up a disastrous showing against the runaway champions. “They are as good a team as I’ve seen in a long time. They have gone to another level. But credit to my team, they never capitulated. “Defensively, we got caught for the goals but they never carved us up like they have with other teams. This game was never going to define our season. “We had odd moments but you have to take your chances. “The way they play is terrific; you don’t really see it until you get close up, it’s so difficult to stop. I won’t criticise my team, we stuck at it. “Pep was very complimentary to us at the end, the spirit they have shown.”
