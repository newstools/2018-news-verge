Atletico Madrid underlined their Europa League favourites’ tag as they marched past Lokomotiv Moscow on Thursday into a powerful-looking quarterfinal draw that will also feature Olympique de Marseille, Lazio and Arsenal. Borussia Dortmund, one of three former European champions to reach the last 16, failed to join them though after a 0-0 draw at Salzburg condemned them to a 2-1 aggregate loss. Atletico’s Fernando Torres struck twice in a 5-1 victory in icy Moscow while Antoine Griezmann was also on target as the La Liga side racked up an 8-1 aggregate triumph. “I admire my players,” said manager Diego Simeone, whose side bowed out at the group stage of the Champions League. “In every match, they always play the same way.” Atletico will be the sole Spanish representative in the last eight after Athletic Bilbao lost 2-1 at home to Marseille, slipping to a 5-2 aggregate loss. Dimitri Payet’s penalty put Marseille in control on the night as the French former European champions claimed their first win away to Spanish opposition. It was revenge for Marseille who were beaten by Bilbao in the round of 32 two years ago. “We are in the quarterfinals but we can’t stop there,” Marseille manager Rudi Garcia said. Arsenal completed a 5-1 aggregate victory over seven-time European champions AC Milan, winning 3-1 on the night in north London after the Italians had scored first. Hakan Calhanoglu’s stunning strike put Milan ahead but the lead lasted only four minutes as Danny Welbeck was awarded a highly-dubious penalty, falling to the ground despite apparently no contact from Milan defender Ricardo Rodriguez. Welbeck converted the 39th minute penalty and added a late header after Granit Xhaka’s goal had put the tie beyond Milan. Victory meant Arsenal snapped a seven-year run of last-16 exits in Europe – all in the Champions League.
