The Kwara State Government has denied allegations of diverting N4 billion loan meant for payment of salaries backlogs for local government staff in the state. The Senior Special Assistant to Kwara State Governor on Media and Communication, Dr. Muideen Akorede disclosed this during an interview with newsmen in Ilorin on Friday. Akorede said the N4billion credit facility for 16 local government areas has not been accessed. He stated that the loan, when accessed, would be paid directly to the LGs and will not be diverted for capital projects. The Governorâ€™s Spokesman however reiterated that the governor is doing everything within his power to ensure prompt release of the loan in order to bring succour to LG workers across the state. He urged affected Council employees to be patient as the bank would release the credit facility soon. Akorede advised opposition party to desist from spreading false information to score cheap political point.
