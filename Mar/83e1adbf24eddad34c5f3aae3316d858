An Abuja based Islamic Cleric, Sheikh Yahya Al-Yolawi has appealed to the Federal Government to ensure respect for constitutional rights and privileges of Muslims in the country.  Al-Yolawi, who is the Chief Imam of Area 10, Garki Abuja Mosque, made the appeal in an interview with our correspondent on Wednesday in Abuja. He stressed the need for government at all levels to ensure the elimination of all forms of discrimination against female Muslims, who wear Hijab, saying that “ wearing Hijab is a fundamental human rights of Muslim women.“ The cleric expressed concern over frequent molestation, intimidation and harassment of Muslim women who use Hijab in obedience to the commandments of Almighty Allah. Al-Yolawi stressed the need for all institutions to understand the common values of freedom, respect and fellowship, and discharge their duties as required in an environment of mutual co-existence. The cleric also admonished those who are profiling and labelling Muslim women that wear Hijab in public places to desist from such behaviour. According to him, Section 38 (1) of the 1999 Constitution and Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Right stipulates that every person shall be entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. “I will like to use this opportunity to appeal to the Federal Government and elites to ensure respect for the constitutional rights and privileges of Islam and Muslims in Nigeria. “The constitutional rights of Muslims are often not being considered in certain things, for example look at the case Firdausi Amasa, a law graduate who was denied call to bar on the account of wearing Hijab. “Also to mention is the examination time table of WAEC which clashed with the time of Jumma’at prayers,” Al-Yolawi noted.
