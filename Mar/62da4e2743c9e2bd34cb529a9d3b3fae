A suspect linked with a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting Austin, Texas, is dead after a major police operation, US media report. The suspect was killed after reportedly detonating a device off an interstate highway in the Round Rock area of the state capital, CBS News reports. FBI agents are reportedly now carrying out an investigation at the scene. The incident follows four bomb attacks in Austin, the state capital, and one in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south. CCTV images of a “person of interest” were earlier shared on US media showing a white male with blond hair carrying a number of large packages. The Austin police department is expected to give a media briefing soon. Austin has been on edge amid the attacks, which have led to the deployment of hundreds of police officers to the city.
