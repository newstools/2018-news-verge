The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has called on the Federal Government to take more drastic actions to end the current security challenge in the country.  APGA National Chairman, Dr Victor Oye, who made the call on Thursday in Awka, said the recent attacks in the North East and the killings in the North Central should not be allowed to continue. “The security situation has become increasingly palpable, so government must do something to restore normalcy and save lives and properties. “The president should do something urgent to arrest the situation before it gets to unimaginable proportion. “A lot of lives have been lost particularly between December 2017 and now. “There is no alternative to tackling the situation frontally and forcefully,” he said. The APGA chairman said the Inspector General of Police and other heads of security agencies should carry out the instruction of the president in ensuring the return of peace in affected areas. Oye also said that state governors should be given more powers to take care of security challenges in their states. “State governors should be given latitude to carry out their constitutional duties of ensuring adequate security in their domains,’’ he said. Oye said APGA has the capacity and is ready to not only provide solution to the menace but to provide alternative government to the All Progressives Congress. “I have made it explicit that APGA is ready to provide alternative leadership for this country. “Our party believes in restructuring as a solution to some of the problems; it is in our constitution,” he said.
