The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has called on the Federal Government to commence immediate recruitment of more people into the security agencies, especially the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Army, to curb crimes. The senior staff union also demanded that the Nigerian Army and the Police should reduce the number of operatives attached to politicians and few influential people to boost those at their operational areas. In a communiqué issued after its National Executive Council (NEC)meeting in Warri, Delta State on Friday and signed by the President, Comrade Francis Olabode Johnson and the General Secretary, Comrade Lumumba Okugbawa, PENGASSANsaid that the security agencies are already over stretched in maintenance of security and peace in the country. “The NEC-in-Session observes the inadequacy in the number of Security Agents, especially the Army and Police who are already overstretched in maintaining security and peace in the Country. There should be immediaterecruitment in these Security Agencies to arrest the situation. “The NEC-in-Session demands that Security operatives attached to VIP’s(Politicians and Powerful Nigerians) in the country should be reduced toincrease their number in operational areas,” the union stated. Recognising the strong and unequivocal commitment of the security agencies in ensuring security of lives and properties within the country, PENGASSANcondemned in strong term the resurfacing of attacks by Boko Haram insurgents, especially the recent abduction of 110 Girls of Government Girls College, Dapchi, Yobe State. PENGASSAN demanded that the Federal Government through the various security agencies should do everything possible in ensuring that the Dapchi Girls and all those in captivity regain freedom and re-unite them with their families. It also advises relevant security agencies to immediately circulateemergency and security numbers for the benefit of Nigerians, as well as check the influx of small arms and ammunitions into the country.
