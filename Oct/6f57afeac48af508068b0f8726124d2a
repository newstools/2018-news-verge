The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi on Monday prayed for peace and unity for the ancient city of Ife, Osun State and the nation.  The Ooni made the ritual prayers when he led indigenes of Ile-Ife to the Okemogun shrine, the Oonirisa Ancestral Traditional Propitiation at the grand finale of the 2018 Olojo festival in Ife Kingdom. He said that peace and unity were the only way out and the pillar capable of strengthening Nigeria’s socio-economic development. “The significance of the festival is that it brings about the unification of the Yoruba race,’’ he said. The royal father said that the Olojo festival was the only day in the year when a special blessing was released by “Olodumare’’, the creator of the universe. He said that Olojo was regarded as the celebration of the creation of the universe. The Ooni therefore admonished everyone to embrace and value their tradition and cultural heritage.
