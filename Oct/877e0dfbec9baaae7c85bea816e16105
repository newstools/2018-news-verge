Germany’s Angela Merkel has said she will step down as chancellor in 2021, following recent election setbacks. Angela Dorothea Merkel has been German Chancellor since 2005 and leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2000. Merkel, disclosed this at a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday. “I will not be seeking any political post after my term ends,” she mentioned. She also said she would not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right CDU party in December. The CDU was severely weakened in Sunday’s poll in the state of Hesse, the latest in a series of setbacks. Both the CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, were 10 percentage points down on the previous poll there.
