Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue has commiserated with his former Adviser on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr Titus Zam, over the death of his son, Master Emmanuel Zam.  The governor, in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, on Wednesday in Makurdi, described the death of the young man as very painful and a big loss to the entire Zam family, friends and relations. Ortom urged the former adviser and his family to take solace in the fact that God is the giver of life to whom their beloved son had returned. He prayed that God would grant the deceased eternal rest and his family the strength to bear the irreparable loss.
