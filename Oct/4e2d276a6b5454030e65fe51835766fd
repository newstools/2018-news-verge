Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state on Wednesday night held a closed- door meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo in his Abeokuta residence.  Aminu who addressed journalists after the meeting which lasted for about 50 minutes and ended few minutes to 9.p.m said he was in Abeokuta to consult with Obasanjo in respect of the 2019 polls. “Obasanjo is one of the critical leaders of the country and it is necessary for me to consult with him concerning the 2019 polls, particularly on my aspiration to contest for the presidency of Nigeria. The governor expressed optimism that Nigeria could still attain greater and enviable height particularly if the citizens vote rightly in the 2019 polls. He advised that every component part of the nation should be given an opportunity and sense of belonging in the Nigerian  context. Tambuwal also urged political gladiators not to make the 2019 election  a matter of “do or die”. He described the clamour by the youths for increased participation in the governance process in Nigeria as ” justified” considering the high percentage of their population in the country. Tambuwal called on the present leadership to accord them more opportunities to participate in governance process.
