Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane, has undergone surgery for a hand injury sustained on international duty with Senegal, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.  Mane missed Senegal’s 1-0 win over Sudan on Tuesday in African Nations Cup qualifier and joined a growing list of injured players at Liverpool ahead of Saturday’s league trip to Huddersfield. “Liverpool Football Club can confirm Sadio Mane today underwent a procedure on a hand injury sustained while on international duty with Senegal. “The surgery, conducted at a north-west hospital and supervised by club medics, was successful. Mane’s recovery will be monitored over the next couple of days.” Another Liverpool player, Naby Keita, went off with a suspected muscle strain in Guinea’s 1-1 draw against Rwanda also on Tuesday. Third-placed Liverpool will look to extend their unbeaten start to the league season at Huddersfield. The Juergen Klopp’s side will entertain Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League next week.
