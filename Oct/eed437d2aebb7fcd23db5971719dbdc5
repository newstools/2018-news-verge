President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, on Sunday, expressed sadness over the death of a former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Idris Kutigi.  In a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Saraki described Kutigi as a honourable jurist, who spent his life in the service of his country and humanity. He described the death of the former CJN as a colossal loss, particularly coming at a time when his experience, dedication and knowledge were needed in the service of the country. The Senate president stated that Kutigi would be remembered for his high sense of integrity, incisive judgements, reform-mindedness and immense contributions to national development. “It saddens me that we have lost a vivacious, humane and tireless jurist. “Eeven in retirement, he was called upon by former President Goodluck Jonathan to chair the Sovereign National Conference in 2014. “We shall all miss him,” Saraki stated. He commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased and urged them to be consoled by the praise-worthy lifestyle of the departed statesman. He also condoled with the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Hon. Justice Walter Onnoghen, the Nigerian Judiciary, the people and government of Niger State over the “irreplaceable loss”. Saraki prayed God to grant the soul of the former CJN “a place among the righteous ones in Aljannah Firdaus and his family and loved ones the grace to bear the loss”.
