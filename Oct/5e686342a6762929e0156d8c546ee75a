Members of the Shi’ite Movement on Monday in Nyanya, a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Mararaba, Nasarawa state, protested the continued detention of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky.  Our correspondent recalls that El-Zakzakky was arrested in 2015 after his members had a confrontation with the convoy of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, in Zaria, Kaduna state. An eye witness, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent that trouble started when the police tried to stop the protesters from moving deeper in the FCT. He said that the protesters resisted the “push’’ by the police for them to retreat and that triggered the skirmish. The source said that some persons lost their lives in the clash but could not state the figure. It was also recalled that 53 of his group also known as Islamic Movement of Nigeria, were recently arrested by the Police in Abuja following a violent protest. Since the arrest and detention of El-Zakzakky, his followers had organised series of protests in some cities in the country, calling for his release. When contacted, Spokesman of the Police Command in the FCT, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said that he had not been briefed on the incident and therefore declined further comment. The Army on Sunday confirmed that three members of the sect died on Saturday, while two soldiers sustained injuries when they clashed with troops at Zuba in the FCT. In the wake of the disturbances at the weekend, the FCT command had assured residents of adequate security against planned protests by the sect in the territory.
