Reports indicate that the United States in Abuja has suspended consular services in Abuja indefinitely. ”Until further notice, all consular appointments at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja have temporarily ceased for both visa and for American Citizen Services. Consular functions in U.S. Consulate Lagos are not affected and will continue”, a statement on the embassy’s website states. ”Scheduled visa and ACS applicants for Abuja will be contacted for rescheduling. American citizens in northern Nigeria with emergency services needs should continue to contact the after-hours emergency number for Abuja at 09461-4000 and press “0” to go to the operator to request assistance”. ”American citizens in northern Nigeria with urgent travel needs who are travelling before Tuesday and who are willing to re-schedule their travel through Lagos should contact the ACS office at Consulate Lagos ( 01460 3400 and LagosACS@state.gov) to discuss their options.  Those travelling after Tuesday should follow up with Abuja ACS to confirm their appointments closer to their appointment date”, the statement added.
