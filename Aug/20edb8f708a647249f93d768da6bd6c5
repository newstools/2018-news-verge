Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state said herdsmen/farmers crises in parts of the country was a major security concern for every Nigerian.  But, he said that as President of the country under the banner of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the menace would be looked at “very comprehensively” and solved. Tambuwal stated this on Thursday while speaking with newsmen after picking PDP’s Nomination and Expression of Interest Forms for the 2019 presidential election. “I believe it is an ‎issue that every responsible government must address and I assure you we can take it head-on and resolve it,” he said. Tambuwal, who arrived at PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, at about 6 p.m., accompanied by some of his aides and supporters, expressed hope that the party would conduct credible primaries “should aspirants fail to go for a consensus candidate”. He said: “I can’t say there is no need for consensus because it is part of democratic process. “If there is a possibility for it, why not? If it is not possible, then we all go for the primaries. “But, I believe that PDP of today is capable of organising free, fair, credible and transparent primaries.” Tambuwal said that considering his antecedent, he had the capacity to confront the ruling-All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate. “I believe you need to check back my political antecedents. I have always been confronted with this kind of hostile environment. “You remember how I emerged as Speaker of the House of Representatives and how I remained there until I left to become the governor. “So, I am not discouraged by whatever that may come up with as a challenge from the APC government.”
