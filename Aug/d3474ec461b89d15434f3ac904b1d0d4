President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met with Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, with former Delta State Governor, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan making a surprise appearance.  Uduaghan was a two-term governor of the oil rich state, under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party between 2007 and 2015. In recent times, there have been unconfirmed reports of his switch to the APC. The meeting was being attended by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and members of the National Executive Committee of the APC led by its chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiohmole. Others attending the meeting were APC governors of Borno, Jigawa, Niger, Plateau, Kogi, Adamawa, Ondo, Kano, Ogun, Oyo, Katsina, Osun, Yobe, Nasarawa, Kebbi, Imo, and Lagos.

Some members of the National Assembly from both Senate and the House of Representatives are also in attendance Our correspondent reliably learnt that the meeting being held behind closed doors would be discussing socio-political issues including the forthcoming APC party primaries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had in January released the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 general elections. The timetable covered the Presidential, National and State Assembly, Governorship and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Council elections. The timetable, which was issued by the INEC chairman, Prof. Yakubu Mahmoud in Abuja, indicated that party primaries for the Presidential, Governorship, Federal and State Elections would begin on Aug. 18 to end on Oct. 7, 2018. The Federal Capital Territory Area Council Elections would commence on Sept. 4 to end on Oct. 27. It was gathered that the meeting of the APC Caucus would deliberate on whether to adopt direct primaries being advocated by the partyâ€™s national chairman, Oshiohmole, or indirect primaries, through delegate system.
