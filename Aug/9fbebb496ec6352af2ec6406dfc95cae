Gov. Ibrahim Dankwambo of Gombe State on Tuesday said that the restructuring of Nigeria was neccessary for the nation to actualise its aspirations.  Dankwambo made the statement in Lagos when he visited members of the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said most the challenges the country was faced with were because of the weak federal system it was operating. The governor, a presidential aspirant in the PDP, said the country must drift towards true federalism in order to achieve its development goals. “The restructuring of the country is imperative for progress .We need to negotiate and re-negotiate the kind of federation we are operating for development. “I believe on true federalism, therefore, I am on the same page with people who support restructuring of the country,” he said. Dankwanbo said the creation of state police, resource control and other ingredients of true federalism would be in the interest of the country if adopted. The presidential said there was the need to address what he called the leadership question in the country, to move it forward. Dankwanbo said it was with a view to take Nigeria to the desired level of development that he offered himself for service. He said he was qualified and experienced, and urged Nigerians to vote right on 2019. The governor commended the new spirit in the PDP, saying the party had been repositioned for greatness. He urged delegates from Lagos to support his aspiration, as he meant well for the country. Also speaking, the secretary of the PDP, Mr Muiz Dosunmu, commended Dankwambo for the visit. He said members of the chapter had no doubt in the ability and capacity of the governor to lead the country.
