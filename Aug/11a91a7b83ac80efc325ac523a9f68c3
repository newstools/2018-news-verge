The governor said: ”I have learnt a few things from this project. It took us almost two years to complete the project and that project cost us N600 million. The turf cost about 1.6million euros plus other things we did “I will like to say that it is a possibility and I will like to do something better in Umuahia Township Stadium than what we have in Enyimba International Stadium. “In the long run it is cheaper and we are not going to go into the problems of re-grassing every year and we are not going to go into the problems of flooded pitch.” Ikpeazu said that his administration was committed to delivering standard Infrastructure that would touch the lives of the people of Abia and boost socio-economic activities.
