Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has urged political leaders and wealthy individuals to contribute their own quota to the transformation of rural communities in the state.  Ugwuanyi made the call on Tuesday while inaugurating an ultra-modern secondary school at Igugu in Udenu Council Area and a three-classroom block built at Aji community in Igboeze Council Area. Our correspondent reports that two projects were executed by a member of House of Representatives, Chief Dennis Agbo, (PDP-Udenu/Igboeze North). The governor commended the lawmaker for executing such projects for the benefit of the people living in rural communities. “These projects will be of great importance to the people, especially our children and their future,’’ Ugwuanyi said. Responding, Agbo said the projects were part of the dividends of democracy he had promised his constituents. “I have offered scholarships to 14 needy constituents including tuition fees, accommodation, books and monthly stipend of N25,000 per student. “We have deliberately used our scholarships to assist the indigent and also encourage the students of medicine. Currently, four of our students on scholarship are medical students. “I have highlighted other concerns of our people in personal and co-sponsored bills at various stages of legislation. “My major initiative is to employ legislative and budgetary intervention to transform our system of animal husbandry in Nigeria,’’ he said. In his remarks, the President-General of Igugu Town Union, Mr Ugwu Casmir, thanked the lawmaker for providing succour to the community by building the school to enhance its educational advancement. “We appreciate all you have done for us. We are hereby categorically assuring you that Igugu community and entire Udenu Council Area are solidly behind you come 2019 general elections,’’ he said.
