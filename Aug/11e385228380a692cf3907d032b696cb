Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has alleged that some members of the National Assembly were planning to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu said this on Wednesday at the formal defection of ex-senate Minority Leader, Sen. Godswill Akpabio, at the Ikot Ekpene township stadium in Akwa Ibom.  NAN reports that he warned the plotters to drop their sinister move because it is not “possible for a lizard to wrestle an antelope’’. He described what was happening in the country now as a war between progressives and the conservatives. “We believe in government of the people, for the people and by the people but the conservatives believe in government of sharing. “We say Nigerian money belongs to Nigerians. We say Nigerians must be given development. We believe in investing in the people. “But they believe in sharing and looting the money. “Today we are aspiring in our vision, but the PDP has no vision. They believe in sharing and looting the treasury,’’ he said. Nigerians, he said, gave PDP 16 years to rule but the party failed. “Today, Buhari says we must change; we must account for Nigeria’s money but they are resisting,’’ he added. He expressed happiness that Akwa Ibom had embraced the change of Buhari.Quoting the Bible, Tinubu, a Muslim said: “The people in the city shall be swept away with brooms.’’ Tinubu, however, praised the wife of Akpabio, Ekaete for her resilience and steadfastness in her support for her husband.
